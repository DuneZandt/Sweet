    <p class="obie">My interests include South Park, music, guitar, Plants Vs Zombies, art, and much more.
        <br>
        <br>
        I draw often and I love to experiment with my artstyle. I can also animate. Those are my main skills, but others include: coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), playing guitar, and creating digital music. I'd like to think I'm a very technical and creative person.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the future, I hope to learn how to 3D animate and how to code games.
        <br>
        <br>
        I have many different kinds of comissions available. If you're interested, check out the work page!</p>
